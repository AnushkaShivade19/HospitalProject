## ‚ùì Problem Statement

In many healthcare clinics and hospitals, patients struggle with:
- Inconvenient booking processes
- Lack of transparency regarding treatment/prescriptions
- Limited online consultation facilities

**Our solution:**  
A robust, **role-based platform** where:
- Patients and doctors have distinct, secure access
- Doctors maintain their full profile & availability
- Patients easily book slots, view their prescriptions & stay updated

This improves **patient-doctor engagement, operational efficiency**, and ensures **data privacy**.

## üíé What Makes This Project Stand Out

- ‚úÖ **Built with Django**: Security, scalability, and rapid development  
- ‚úÖ **Role-Based Access**: Separate modules for patients & doctors  
- ‚úÖ **Production-Ready Stack**: Suitable for real deployments using Gunicorn/Nginx  
- ‚úÖ **Database-Ready**: Works out of the box with SQLite, easy migration to PostgreSQL  
- ‚úÖ **Image Handling**: Uses Pillow for profile pictures (a real-world production feature)  
- ‚úÖ **Clean & Responsive UI**: Bootstrap 5 + Crispy Forms integration  
- ‚úÖ **Extensible APIs**: Prepared for mobile apps or Single Page Apps (with DRF)  
- ‚úÖ **Deployment-Friendly**: Designed with environment variable configs (using `django-environ`)
